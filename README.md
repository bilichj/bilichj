### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
I'm an machine learning researcher, software engineer, low-key 
mathematics doctoral student, and a preschool parent.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about information theory as it 
relates to finance, NLP, and distributed computing.

I'm starting a list of things that I'd be interested in collaborating on:
- Many-player financial simulations involving language

  - It's a classical fact that extra infromation can increase the 
growth rate of a portfolio by at most by the mutual information.
I'd like to study this in practice with the abundance of financial
data and linguistic side information from the common crawl for example.

- A distributed wysiwyg latex editor.
  - I ran into this problem teaching math in 2020, online, of course. I was always of the mind that
math should be done with pencil and paper. But the reality is, students are now
quite used to entering homework answers with a wysiwyg equation editor. It's most effective
to teach and learn in the same context where the information will be used. So, I'd like to add a
websockets interface to something like [MathQuill](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill).
Edits would propagate via [operational transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation).
  - More generally, if the trend is that students are going to use the computer
to work out problems instead of pencil and paper, then let's give them better tools to work through problems.
If we can watch a student do the work for a problem, we can automatically identify where they're having difficulty.
Knowing that most of her class is hung up on factoring by grouping would be invaluable to the math instructor.

- And anything else you think might be interesting and good for the world!
